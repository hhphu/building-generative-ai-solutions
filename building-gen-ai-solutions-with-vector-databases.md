# Building Generative AI solutions with Vector Databases
- Vector Databases are designed to store and manage vector data, which represents information in a numerical format that machines can understand.
- Serves as long-term memory that allows AI models to recall relevant information without being re-trained.
- Use cases:
  - Search and recommender systems
  - Computer vision (used to detect audio/videos, used for deep researchs & trainings)
  - Generative AI: allow applications to generate outputs that are relevant to the users and provided contexts.
- Outline:
  - Vector Search
      - Vector distance
      - Embedding functions
  - Basic operations of vector databases
      - Storing and managing data
      - Querying vector databases
  - Indexing
      - KNN vs ANN
      - ANN techniques
